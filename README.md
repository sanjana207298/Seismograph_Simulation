# Seismograph_Simulation
Explore seismic dynamics using a mathematical model of a mass-spring-damper system. Visualize earthquake-induced displacement and Richter scale intensity. Code includes numerical integration with Runge-Kutta method and dynamic animation. Gain insights into seismograph mechanics and seismic activity simulation.
